🧠 RAG: Senhor das LLMs

    Disclaimer: This notebook was not created by me. I'm simply using it as a study resource to deepen my understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

📘 About

This Jupyter Notebook explores the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — a technique used to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models by combining them with external knowledge sources during inference.

Topics covered may include:

    The fundamentals of RAG

    How RAG improves factual accuracy

    Architecture overview

    Example code using LLMs and document retrieval tools

    Vector stores, embeddings, and similarity search

The original content is highly educational and provided a great foundation for understanding how to combine retrieval mechanisms with generative AI models.
📚 Purpose

This notebook served as a study tool for me to:

    Understand the theory and implementation of RAG

    Practice applying RAG to real-world problems

    Learn from well-structured code examples
